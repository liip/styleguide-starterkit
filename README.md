# Styleguide starterkit

A starterkit to create web styleguides with [Fractal](http://fractal.build/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

- Fractal pre-configured with [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/)
- JavaScript bundling with Webpack and [Babel](http://babeljs.io/)
- Sass compilation, including [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)
- [SVG icons sprite](https://css-tricks.com/svg-symbol-good-choice-icons/) generation
- Live reload (with hot module replacement) for comfortable development
- Automated release management with [release-it](https://github.com/webpro/release-it)


## Installation

Prerequisites: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 6, <= 10

Inside the directory of your choice, install a copy of the starterkit with:

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/liip/styleguide-starterkit/archive/master.tar.gz | tar zx --strip 1
```

Then install the npm dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
```


## Getting started

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

You can now access your styleguide at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

You’re all set, start to:

- Create components as `.nunj` (Nunjucks) files inside the `components` directory
- Write some style inside `assets/scss/common.scss`
- Write JavaScript inside `assets/scripts/common.js`
- Put some `*.svg` icons in the `assets/icons` directory
- Write documentation as `.md` (Markdown) files inside the `docs` directory.


## Build

You can build a static version of the styleguide to deploy it wherever you like by running:

```
npm run build
```

The generated files go to the `dist` directory.


## Release

The starterkit comes with a preconfigured release management tool. It will automatically update the `CHANGELOG.md` file at the root of the project based on the commit messages as long as they follow the [Angular commit guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines). It will also bump the version number in the `package.json`, run the build command above, commit, tag and push the changes. This process is interactive and you’ll be able to skip steps manually if you like.

To release a new version run:

```bash
npm run release [patch|minor|major|version_number]
```

By default the version bump is automatically determined based on the commits messages.

Read more in the [release-it documentation](https://github.com/webpro/release-it).

## Deploy

To deploy a build of the styleguide, simply replace the blank command in the `package.json`, under `scripts -> deploy`. This will be automatically invoked at the end of the release process described above.

An example of a simple deploy command using `rsync`:

```json
"deploy": "rsync -avz --delete --exclude='.*' dist/ user@server.com:/var/www/html/my-styleguide"
```

⚠️ Notice the `--delete` flag which means all files not present locally will be deleted on the remote server. Be careful, this can leads to data loss!

You can also deploy manually at any time by running:

```bash
npm run deploy
```


## Misc

### Browsers support

The browsers support is defined in `.browserslistrc`. It’s used both by [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) for the CSS and by [@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env) for the JavaScript.

Check [browserslist’s documentation](https://github.com/ai/browserslist) to change the browser support.

### Icons

Icons placed inside `assets/icons` are combined into a sprite called `icons.svg` when referenced. To load them, either reference them in your JavaScript:

```js
import 'icons/foo.svg';
```

Or in your stylesheet:

```scss
background-image: url('../icons/foo.svg');
```

Webpack will automatically rewrite the links to the sprite with the correct identifier. See [svg-sprite-loader](https://github.com/kisenka/svg-sprite-loader) documentation for more information.

You can then easily use an icon in a template with the icon snippet:

```nunj
{% render '@icon', { id: 'foo', class: 'bar' } %}
```

**Warning:** This method of including remote SVG file is not supported by Internet Explorer 11 and below. You may want to polyfill it with [svgxuse](https://github.com/Keyamoon/svgxuse).
